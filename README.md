Basic implementation of a classification algorithm named logistic regression.

# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning algorithm which is used for the classification problems, it is a predictive analysis algorithm and based on the concept of probability.
Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like linear regression.

The coefficients (Beta values b) of the logistic regression algorithm must be estimated from your training data. This is done using maximum-likelihood estimation.

I used the following as a resource to implement and learn the same:
